You want to build software. The official Spec-Kit docs are good, but they're **dense**. 

You read them → You get confused → You make mistakes → **You don't know what to do when things break.**

## 🚨 The Game Changer: Error Recovery Guide

**This is what you won't find anywhere else.**

### The Reality:
```
You run: /speckit.implement
Something breaks: ❌ Error!
You think: "Now what?" 😰
```

### This Guide Answers:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| 🔍 **What type of error?** | Build / Runtime / Test / Deployment |
| 🎯 **What caused it?** | Bad spec? Bad plan? Bad code? |
| ↩️ **Where to go back?** | Exact command to fix it |
| 🛠️ **How to fix it?** | Step-by-step recovery |

### Real Example:

```diff
❌ Problem: Tests fail after implementation

✅ Solution:
1. Run /speckit.analyze
2. Find the mismatch (spec vs code)
3. Fix at the source
4. Re-run from there

Simple. Clear. Done.
```

## 🎯 Why This Guide Exists

> **The official Spec-Kit is powerful. But power without clarity is frustrating.**

### The Split:

| Official Docs | This Guide |
|--------------|------------|
| ✅ What the tool does | ✅ How to actually use it |
| ✅ Technical reference | ✅ What to do when it breaks |
| ✅ Core features | ✅ Real-world examples |

**Both are needed. Use both.**

Always check the [official repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for updates.
