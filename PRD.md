2. **Achieve Top 10 Google Rankings** for 20 target keywords within 4 months
3. **3x Increase in User Engagement** - average session duration >4 minutes, bounce rate <40%

### Background Context

**Current State:**
Alsoadaa Import & Export Company is an established Egyptian exporter (since 2009) specializing in citrus, fruits, and vegetables to European, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. The company holds ISO 9001 and Global G.A.P certifications and serves B2B customers including importers, distributors, and large retailers.

**Problem:**
The existing website (https://www.alsoadaa.com/eng) suffers from:
- Poor UX with cluttered design and slow performance (>5 second load times)
- Weak SEO foundation limiting organic visibility in target markets
- Static content with no dynamic seasonal availability information
- Limited trust signals and modern communication channels

**Strategic Context:**
- Post-COVID shift to digital-first B2B procurement
- Competitive pressure from modernized Egyptian exporters
- Growing international demand for Egyptian agricultural products
- Content (photos, certifications, product info) is ready and available

**Investment:**
- Budget: $15,000 - $25,000
- Expected ROI: 24x - 96x in first year (based on average contract value of $50K-$200K per customer)
- Break-even: <1 month (single additional customer covers development cost)
